Use Apache Commons Collections for this implementation, no database should be used. Store user records using any of the collections of Apache.
Be creative and store user details and TODO tasks using only the collections in Apache, use the collections as much as you can and need to. 


## NB:
A user can log into his account using email, and password; and should be able to update his details(i.e Password) if he chooses to.
No two user can share the same email in the application
